Sybase (SAP ASE) to Oracle Exadata vs. Microsoft SQL Server Migration DB Object Level Comparison
Component	Oracle Exadata	Microsoft SQL Server
Tables	Requires mapping of Sybase IDENTITY columns to Oracle SEQUENCE + TRIGGER logic. Table partitioning needs careful handling.	Direct mapping using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA). Sybase IDENTITY maps directly to SQL Server IDENTITY.
Views	Manual adjustments needed due to differences in SQL syntax, especially joins and function usage.	More straightforward migration with SSMA; minor syntax adjustments may be required.
Stored Procedures	Requires rewriting due to different procedural languages (Transact-SQL vs. PL/SQL). Cursors and error handling need modifications.	T-SQL is similar to Sybase's Transact-SQL, so migration is smoother with SSMA and SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).
Triggers	Needs manual rewriting since Sybase triggers allow AFTER, BEFORE, and INSTEAD OF logic, whereas Oracle primarily supports AFTER and BEFORE triggers.	Similar trigger syntax in T-SQL makes migration easier. SSMA helps automate some conversions.
Indexes	B-tree indexes map well, but Full-Text and Clustered Indexes require special handling. Bitmap Indexes (Oracle) may be used for optimization.	SQL Server supports both clustered and non-clustered indexes similar to Sybase, making migration simpler.
Constraints (PK, FK, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT)	Requires careful validation, especially for default values and NOT NULL constraints.	Easier migration, as most constraints map directly using SSMA.
User-defined Data Types (UDTs)	Oracle does not support Sybase-style UDTs directly; requires conversion to built-in types or Oracle Object Types.	SQL Server supports User-Defined Data Types (UDTs), making migration easier.
Functions (Scalar & Table-Valued)	Scalar functions require conversion from T-SQL to PL/SQL. Table-Valued Functions (TVFs) may need refactoring into PIPELINED or REF CURSOR functions.	SQL Server supports Scalar and Table-Valued Functions, making migration easier. SSMA provides partial automation.
Sequences	Sybase IDENTITY columns need to be replaced with Oracle SEQUENCE + TRIGGER logic.	SQL Server IDENTITY columns can be mapped directly; if sequences are needed, they can be created manually.
Synonyms	Oracle supports synonyms, but cross-database synonyms require manual configuration.	SQL Server supports synonyms natively, allowing direct migration.
User Profiles and Permissions	Sybase GRANT/REVOKE permissions need manual mapping to Oracle roles and privileges. sp_adduser and sp_addlogin must be rewritten.	SQL Server permissions closely resemble Sybase, making migration smoother. SSMA automates most of this.
Database Links (Cross-DB Queries)	Sybase REMOTE SERVER links must be replaced with Oracle DB LINK, requiring reconfiguration and authentication changes.	SQL Server supports Linked Servers, allowing easier migration of cross-server queries.
Partitioning	Sybase RANGE and HASH partitioning must be manually converted to Oracle’s PARTITION BY syntax. Requires testing to optimize performance.	SQL Server natively supports partitioning, making migration easier with PARTITION FUNCTION and PARTITION SCHEME.
Transactions & Locking Mechanisms	Requires adjustments due to differences in transaction isolation levels, optimistic/pessimistic locking, and redo/undo logs.	SQL Server’s transaction management is closer to Sybase’s, making migration easier.
Data Files & Log Files	Oracle uses tablespaces, which require reconfiguring Sybase devices and segments. 	SQL Server handles MDF and LDF files natively, making file-level migration simpler.

Additional Migration Considerations

1. Data Type Mapping Challenges
	• Sybase MONEY → Oracle NUMBER(19,4)
	• Sybase DATETIME → Oracle TIMESTAMP or DATE
	• Sybase TEXT/IMAGE → Oracle CLOB/BLOB
	• Sybase BIT → Oracle NUMBER(1)
	• Sybase VARBINARY → SQL Server VARBINARY(MAX) (direct mapping)
SQL Server has more one-to-one mappings with Sybase, while Oracle requires more manual intervention.

2. Migration Tools
Tool	Oracle Exadata	Microsoft SQL Server
SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA)	❌ Not available	✅ Automates schema and data migration
Oracle SQL Developer Migration Workbench	✅ Helps migrate schema and data, but requires manual adjustments	❌ Not applicable
GoldenGate/Data Pump	✅ Helps with live data replication	❌ Not applicable
DBConvert/DBSync	✅ Used for schema and data conversion	✅ Supports direct Sybase to SQL Server migration


Migration to Oracle Exadata
	• More manual effort required, especially for procedural logic (PL/SQL vs. T-SQL).
	• Complex storage differences (tablespaces, redo/undo logs, partitions) need careful planning.
	• Powerful for high-performance analytics and scalability once migration is optimized.
Migration to Microsoft SQL Server
	• Easier transition due to similar SQL dialects and built-in migration tools.
	• Less manual rewriting of stored procedures, triggers, and functions.
	• Closer compatibility with Sybase's architecture and transaction management.


Which one to choose ?
	• Choose Oracle Exadata if you need maximum performance, mission-critical HA, and deep Oracle workload integration.
Choose Microsoft SQL Server if you want cost-efficient cloud scalability, hybrid cloud flexibility, and easy integration with Microsoft ecosystems.
