Title
"System and Method for Calculating and Reporting Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Email Communications"

Abstract
A plugin for email clients that automatically calculates and reports the carbon footprint of email communications. The plugin considers various factors, including email attachments, recipient lists, and email transmission protocols, to estimate the CO2 emissions generated by each email.

Detailed Description
*1. Automatic CO2 Calculation*
- The plugin integrates with popular email clients to track email composition and transmission.
- Upon attaching files or adding recipients, the plugin calculates the estimated CO2 emissions based on factors such as:
    - Attachment size and type
    - Recipient location and number
    - Email transmission protocols (e.g., SMTP, IMAP)
    - Server locations and energy consumption

*2. Real-time Emissions Alert*
- As users add recipients or attachments, the plugin displays a real-time estimate of the increased CO2 emissions.
- Alerts consider CC and BCC recipients, ensuring accurate emissions calculations.

*3. Email Footer with Emissions Details*
- The plugin appends a footer to outgoing emails, displaying the estimated CO2 emissions generated by the email.
- This feature promotes transparency and encourages users to consider the environmental impact of their email communications.

*4. Reporting and Analytics*
- The plugin stores email emissions data for later reporting and analysis.
- Users can access dashboards to track their email-related carbon footprint over time, identifying opportunities to reduce their environmental impact.
